### Example

# Additional Information

### Timezones

* All datetime strings must be ISO 8601 formatted, including timezone offset (e.g. `"2025-07-03T15:00:00+01:00"`).
* The server uses Europe/London timezone internally and will localize naive timestamps accordingly.

### Filenames

* Recorded files are saved to the `recordings/` directory with sanitized filenames including start time, channel ID, and title.

### Errors

* If required parameters are missing or invalid, the API will respond with status 400 and a JSON error message.
* If trying to schedule a recording already scheduled for the exact same start time, the API will return error 400.

### Concurrency and Threading

* The scheduler runs in a separate background thread, starting and stopping scheduled recordings automatically.
* Manual start/stop endpoints remain fully functional.

# Example Workflow

1. **Schedule a future recording**
   POST to `/api/recordings/schedule` with channel and start/stop times.

2. **List scheduled recordings**
   GET `/api/recordings/scheduled`

3. **Wait for the scheduler to start recording at the right time**
   The recording starts automatically in the background.

4. **List active recordings**
   GET `/api/recordings`

5. **Stop a recording manually (if desired)**
   POST to `/api/recordings/stop` with the recording ID.

If you want, I can also generate a **Postman collection** or a **Python client example** for easy API interaction. Just say the word!
